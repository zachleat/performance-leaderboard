# performance-leaderboard

A plugin to run Lighthouse against a set of urls to see which site is the fastest.

## Installation

```sh
npm install performance-leaderboard
```

## Features

* Median Run Selection: `performance-leaderboard` will run Lighthouse on the same site multiple times and select the Median run. It factors in First Contentful Paint, Largest Contentful Paint, and Time to Interactive when [selecting the median run](https://github.com/zachleat/performance-leaderboard/blob/master/lib/lh-median-run.js#L55).

## Usage

1. Create a test file, say `sample.js`:

```js
const PerfLeaderboard = require("performance-leaderboard");

(async function() {

	let urls = [
		"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/",
		"https://nextjs.org/",
		"https://www.11ty.dev/",
		"https://vuejs.org/",
		"https://reactjs.org/",
		"https://jekyllrb.com/",
		"https://nuxtjs.org/",
		"https://gohugo.io/",
	];

	// Run each site 3 times
	console.log( await PerfLeaderboard(urls) );

	// Or run each site 5 times
	console.log( await PerfLeaderboard(urls, 5) );
})();
```

2. Run `node sample.js`.

## Rankings

In the return object you’ll see a `ranks` object listing how this site compares to the other sites in the set. There are a bunch of different scoring algorithms you can choose from:

* `ranks.performance`
	* The highest Lighthouse performance score.
	* Tiebreaker given to the lower SpeedIndex score.
* `ranks.accessibility`
	* The highest Lighthouse accessibility score.
	* Tiebreaker given to lower Axe violations.
	* Second tiebreaker given to highest Axe passes (warning: each instance of an Axe rule passing is treated separately so this will weigh heavily in favor of larger pages)
* `ranks.hundos`
	* The sum of all four Lighthouse scores.
	* Tiebreaker given to the lower Speed Index / Total Page Weight ratio.
* `ranks.cumulative` (the same as `hundos` but with an Axe tiebreaker)
	* The sum of all four Lighthouse scores.
	* Tiebreaker given to the lower Axe violations.
	* Second tiebreaker given to the lower Speed Index / Total Page Weight ratio.
